# 🚀 NVIDIA Warp + OpenUSD Industrial Spray Simulation

A research-oriented physics-based spray painting simulation built using NVIDIA Isaac Warp and Pixar OpenUSD to model real-world industrial coating processes.

A physics-inspired spray painting simulation built using NVIDIA Isaac Warp and OpenUSD, demonstrating how paint particles accumulate over time on a wall surface and visualized in a fully animated 3D scene.

This project models a robotic/industrial spray-painting workflow with configurable spray parameters and real-time visualization.

🚀 Project Overview

This simulation demonstrates:

A moving spray nozzle emitting paint in a triangular fan pattern

Real-time paint accumulation on a wall surface

Time-based texture updates mapped onto a 3D wall mesh

Visualization using Pixar OpenUSD (usdview)
The goal is to replicate an industrial robotic paint spraying process using physics-inspired computation and USD-based visualization.
